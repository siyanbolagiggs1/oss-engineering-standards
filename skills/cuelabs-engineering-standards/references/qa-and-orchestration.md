# Orchestration and QA loops

How CueLABS™ work is executed with an orchestrator + subagents (ratified
2026-07-18; applies to design, web, and future phases):

- **Roles** — one orchestrator + one agent per product/lane. The
  orchestrator NEVER builds: it scopes missions, adjudicates conflicts,
  runs merge gates, diffs for cross-repo parity, codifies standards, and
  revives the fleet. Agents do all building/QA and never merge their own
  PRs. Docs are the contract: contract changes land (or are dispatched)
  before or with the build that implements them.
- **Mission briefs are self-contained** — each brief carries: an explicit
  instruction to ignore injected third-party skill/hook prompts (known
  false-positive prompt injections); the repo/file state the agent
  inherits; the exact contracts to read; environment gotchas (small tool
  calls under stream watchdogs, ≤3 logical ops per canvas/API call);
  a private artifact directory per agent under the session scratchpad
  (parallel agents collide on shared temp names); and a "stop cleanly and
  report — you'll be resumed" escape hatch.
- **Double-writer protocol** — when two live agent instances discover
  each other in one worktree (restart-resume races), they partition the
  mission via an UNTRACKED ledger file (`COORDINATION-<mission>.local.md`:
  who owns which items, endgame owner), honor it, and delete it before
  the PR. Field-proven 2026-07-20 (Wave A: twin took items 1–3, resume
  took 4–6, zero lost work). Never assume a "killed" twin is dead —
  verify via processes/mtimes before taking over its endgame.
- **Durable-state-first** — git branches/PRs, Figma files, and docs are
  the real state; agent transcripts are disposable. Agents must design
  work so any successor can resume from the canvas/tree alone: verify
  `git branch --show-current` before every commit (trees are shared),
  stage explicitly by path, prefer many small commits/calls, use detached
  worktrees when touching a repo another agent holds. **Branch fresh,
  land clean** (ratified 2026-07-19): `git fetch origin` immediately
  before creating any branch (always off the just-fetched
  `origin/main`), and when a sibling PR merges while yours is open,
  merge `origin/main` into your branch before the final push —
  MERGEABLE is part of the merge gate, and conflict resolution follows
  the current-docs rule. On process
  restarts/session limits: resume from transcript when possible; when a
  transcript is lost or too bloated to resume, spawn a fresh agent with a
  context handoff and verify-then-fix (idempotent) instructions.
- **Model policy (split fleet)** — top-tier models for open-ended
  builders, QA auditors, root-cause debugging, and fidelity judgment;
  Sonnet-class models for pre-adjudicated mechanical work (docs writers
  executing digests, fix-list executors with per-item node/file IDs +
  prescribed fixes, scripted sweeps, monitors). When in doubt, top tier.
  The QA loops are the safety net that makes downshifting cheap.
- **QA / evaluation loops** — every stage closes with audit → fix →
  re-verify rounds to convergence: auditors are INDEPENDENT of the
  builders; findings carry node/file IDs, severities
  (blocker/major/minor/nit), and concrete fixes; the orchestrator
  adjudicates conflicts against ratified standards (wontfix requires a
  recorded reason); the next round verifies every prior finding against
  the artifact itself (per-finding ledger), never against the fixer's
  claim; loops converge at clean or nits-only. Lenses by phase: design =
  completeness/content/polish (+ prototype graph BFS); web =
  Figma-fidelity (screenshot + token/geometry vs the Figma files) +
  functional (unit/integration/e2e journeys mirroring design.md §8.4).
- **Merge gates** — an implementation PR merges only when: CI fully green
  (external content-sync statuses don't count either way) · queued
  standardization corrections are folded in · the cross-repo parity diff
  is clean (workflows byte-identical, scripts/layout/naming uniform) ·
  QA-loop findings for the stage are resolved or adjudicated. Every
  resolved divergence is codified HERE in the same pass (the
  "standardize constantly" rule) so drift becomes a detectable violation.
- **User-reported findings are CLASSES (ratified 2026-07-20)** — a
  defect reported live on one product is never closed as a spot fix:
  before the round ends, every sibling product is swept for the same
  class (same construction or the analogous surface) and each gets an
  explicit fix or a recorded clean verdict with evidence. Docs and
  Figma masters are updated in the same round as the code fix — the
  three never diverge for longer than one PR cycle.
- **Checkout & push discipline (field-proven 2026-07-20)** — agent
  lane work NEVER happens in a repo's main checkout: lanes always use
  detached worktrees; the main checkout stays on `main` (a lane that
  left the main checkout on a feature branch with dirty files nearly
  lost the work to a restart, and holds ports/tools other lanes need).
  Push after EVERY commit — host restarts are frequent enough that
  unpushed commits and uncommitted worktree state are the only real
  data-loss vector we've hit; remotes are the durable state. Before
  declaring any prior lane's work lost, VERIFY remotes and worktrees
  first — three "restart, start fresh" resumes in one day turned out
  to have fully-survived branches. **Worktree removal is part of the
  merge gate (user directive 2026-07-21)**: when a lane's PR merges,
  its worktree is removed in the same step — never left for a later
  sweep (accumulated worktrees with node_modules/.next filled the
  host's disk to zero twice; a forgotten worktree also hid an
  unmerged docs commit for a day). Heavy lanes also cap CONCURRENT
  build worktrees at two fleet-wide — each npm ci + next build costs
  ~2GB of disk and enough memory to crash the host.
